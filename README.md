# Current Lifestyle Retirement Calculator

A retirement calculator that estimates how much you should be putting away each month to sustain your current lifestyle during retirement.

Check it out [here](https://current-lifestyle.vercel.app/).

I had this on a Python notebook and saw a good opportunity to try out [Vercel](https://vercel.com)'s serverless runtime. It was a nice experience and it's cool to be able to build websites using other languages.

The contents of the `/api` directory are served automatically if you stick to certain conventions, which support using Flask, which simplifies request handling. You can see the actual calculator in the `/lib` directory.
